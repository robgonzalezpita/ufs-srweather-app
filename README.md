# UFS Short-Range Weather Application

The Unified Forecast System (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth modeling system. It is designed to be the source system for NOAAâ€™s operational numerical weather prediction applications while enabling research, development, and contribution opportunities for the broader weather enterprise. For more information about the UFS, visit the UFS Portal at https://ufscommunity.org/.

The UFS includes multiple applications (see a complete list at https://ufscommunity.org/science/aboutapps/) that support different forecast durations and spatial domains. This documentation describes the UFS Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application, which targets predictions of atmospheric behavior on a limited spatial domain and on time scales from minutes to several days. The development branch of the application is continually evolving as the system undergoes open development. The SRW App release branches represent a snapshot of this continuously evolving system. The SRW Application includes a prognostic atmospheric model, pre- and post-processing, and a community workflow for running the system end-to-end. These components are documented within the User's Guide and supported through a community forum (https://forums.ufscommunity.org/). 

The UFS SRW App User's Guide associated with the development branch can be found at: https://ufs-srweather-app.readthedocs.io/en/develop/, while the guide specific to the SRW App v1.0.1 release can be found at: https://ufs-srweather-app.readthedocs.io/en/ufs-v1.0.1/.
