# Users should load the appropriate python environment for the workflow. 
# The workflow requires Python 3, with the packages 'PyYAML', 'Jinja2', and 'f90nml' available.

# For users' convenience, the python environment for the workflow can be activated by loading wflow_[PLATFORM] modulefile

# For example, on Hera:

module load wflow_hera

# Due to older version of Lmod, inconsistency with TCL modulefiles etc, you may have to activate
# conda manually using instructions that the previous module command prints.
# Hera is one of those systems, so execute:

conda activate regional_workflow

# After that we can setup an experiment in the directory

cd regional_workflow/ush

# Once we prepare experiment file config.sh, we can generate workflow using

./generate_FV3LAM_wflow.sh
